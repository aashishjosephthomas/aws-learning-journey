# AWS IAM Hands-On  

## ðŸ”¹ What I Did:
âœ… Created an IAM User & assigned it to multiple Groups  
âœ… Configured Group-based & Inline Policies for permission control  
âœ… Wrote a Custom IAM Policy for fine-grained access  
âœ… Tested permission removals & restricted access  

## ðŸ”¹ Key IAM Concepts I Learned:
- **IAM Groups simplify permission management**  
- **Custom Policies help implement Least Privilege Access**  
- **Inline Policies should be used sparingly** to avoid user-specific complexity  
- **IAM Roles are better for cross-account or service-based access**
