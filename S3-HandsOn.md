# AWS S3 Hands-On  

## ðŸ”¹ What I Did:
âœ… Created an S3 bucket (`ajosephthomas-s3-demo`)  
âœ… Uploaded files to AWS S3  
âœ… Configured an IAM policy to restrict access  

## ðŸ”¹ Key S3 Concepts I Learned:
- **S3 Buckets must be globally unique**  
- **IAM policies control S3 access** (bucket-level & object-level permissions)  
- **Public access is blocked by default for security reasons**
