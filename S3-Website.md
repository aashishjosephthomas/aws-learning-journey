# AWS S3 Static Website Hosting

## ðŸ”¹ What I Did:
âœ… Enabled Static Website Hosting in S3  
âœ… Uploaded an `index.html` file  
âœ… Configured Bucket Policy for public read access  
âœ… Successfully hosted a website via S3  

## ðŸ”¹ Key S3 Hosting Concepts:
- **S3 can serve static websites** (HTML, CSS, JS onlyâ€”no PHP or databases).  
- **Bucket policies control public access** (IAM alone wonâ€™t work).  
- **S3 Website Endpoints are region-specific**.
